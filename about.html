						<p>Draft Craft has one mission&mdash;bring high quality craft beer to the masses. We believe that beer is an art, and that only beers brewed with care and craft should be enjoyed. Everything else should be discarded and ignored. That's why our motto is: Life Is Short&mdash;Drink Well. If you're going to drink beer, it should always be the only the best beer.</p>
						<p>We opened our doors in 2017 with the decision to feature local craft beers from the best craft breweries in the Tampa Bay area. We're proud to partner with local breweries to feature their beers and bring awareness to the fine products they produce. Never will there be a mass produced, generic beer hogging even a single of our precious taps. While we focus mainly on local breweries, we do occassionally reserve a tap for non-local breweries that have excellent brews that we are confident in featuring.</p>
						<p>We hope that everyone will discover new and wonderful beers here, and that we can broaden your beer drinking horizon by introducing new breweries may not have not been widely known. Our desire if that our patrons fall in love with the many excellent craft breweries (and their beers) in the Greater Tampa Bay area, and that we can make a life long craft beer enthusiast out of everyone.</p>
						<p>To Life!</p>
